    <h1> such a life- changing experience .highly recommended !</h1>
    <p> before joining the bootcamp !i've never writen a line of code i needed some structure from profesionels who can help me learn programming step by step . i was encouraged to enroll by a former student at theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program the entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint they were very hands -on and i never had to wait long for long for assisstance the again team project in particular was outsdanding it it took my learning in the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have . in fact i've often referred to it during interviews as an exemple of my developpement experience it certainllly helped me land a job as a hull stack developper after receving  multiple offers 100% recommend !    </p>
